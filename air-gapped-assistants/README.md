# AIr Gapped Assistants

Converse with an AI Assistant on an unprivileged device.

## Overview

An AI Policy that prevents use of your preferred tools (e.g. Claude Code) on
company devices / data can be frustrating.

One option that enables you to get around this is to run your agent on an
unprivileged device (laptop, tablet, phone, VPS) and converse with it using
voice.

It's like calling the ultimate tech support:

- No waiting on hold
- Faster and more capable than most human counterparts
- Can write code that can be shuttled to the employer / client device

## Benefits of Voice

- You can speak with Assistant that isn't running on the host you're working at
- Reading an error message aloud is quicker than retyping text
